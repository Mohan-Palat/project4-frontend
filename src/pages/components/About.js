            <p>This is the final project of a web development class I took in 2020.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this occured on the weekend of Thanksiving, 2020 when the household decided to listen to Christmas music while decorating the house.</p>
            <p>The music source was <a href="https://magic983.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Magic 98.3</a>, a FM station located in Central New Jersey.</p>
            <p>In the 2.5 hours of decorating, it seemed like some of the songs were repeated so I decided to research further.</p>
            <p>Below are the findings.  Enjoy and Happy Holidays!</p>
